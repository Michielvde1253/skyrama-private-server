# Skyrama Private Server

A simple version of a server for the game Skyrama. Not all features have been implemented, and even the ones that are probably contain bugs. Any help is welcome :)

Besides that, keep in mind that passwords are not protected as of now!


## Legal Issues

I'm aware of the fact that there are legal problems with this project. It is only made for learning purposes and should not even be trusted. To Bigpoint: if you have any problems with this, please contact me and I will take it out of Github. Thanks!
## How to run

In order to run the code, simply download the .zip from Github and run server.py.

You will need a browser that supports flash (and flash player itself) to run the game. I personally recommend https://flash.pm/browser/ .
